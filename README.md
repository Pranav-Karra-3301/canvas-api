# Canvas API (for TypeScript and JavaScript)

```shell
npm i @kth/canvas-api
```

Node.JS HTTP client (for both TypeScript and JavaScript) for the [Canvas LMS API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)

## Getting Started

First, generate a token by going to `«YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE»/profile/settings`. For example https://canvas.kth.se/profile/settings. Then you can do something like:

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";

console.log("Making a GET request to /accounts/1");
const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);

const { json } = await canvas.get("accounts/1");
console.log(json);
```

> **Deprecation Notice**: The `.body` property on response objects is deprecated. Use `.json` for parsed JSON data or `.text` for raw string responses instead. The `.body` property will be removed in a future major version.

## Features

### SIS Imports

Use the method `.sisImport()`

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";

const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);

const buffer = await readFile("<FILE PATH>");

// Note: you must give the file name with the correct extension
const file = new File([buffer], "test.csv");

const { json } = await canvas.sisImport(file);
console.log(json);
```

If you need to pass extra parameters to Canvas, create a `FormData` object and pass it as `body` to the `request()` method:

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";

const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);

const buffer = await readFile("<FILE PATH>");
const file = new File([buffer], "test.csv");
const formData = new FormData();
formData.set("attachment", file);
formData.set("key", "value");

const { json } = await canvas.request(
  "accounts/1/sis_import",
  "POST",
  formData,
);
console.log(json);
```

### Pagination

Use the method `.listPages` to automatically traverse pages.

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";

const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);

const pages = canvas.listPages("accounts/1/courses");

for await (const { json } of pages) {
  console.log(json);
}
```

If the page returns a list of items, you can use `.listItems` to traverse through the items.

Note: the returned iterator does not include response headers

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";

const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);

const courses = canvas.listItems("accounts/1/courses");

for await (const course of courses) {
  console.log(course);
}
```

### Rate Limiting

CanvasApi will automatically handle rate limiting by throttling calls. Throttling is applied globally for all your CanvasApi instances using a **global singleton queue**. This means that even if you create multiple `CanvasApi` instances, they all share the same rate limiter to prevent overwhelming the Canvas API.

The rate limiter uses a FIFO-queue where each call is resolved sequentially. If Canvas returns a rate limit error (HTTP 403 with "Rate Limit Exceeded"), the library will automatically retry the request up to **5 times** with appropriate delays.

#### Configuration Options

```ts
const canvas = new CanvasApi("https://canvas.local/", "token", {
  // Customize the rate limit check interval (default: 1000ms)
  rateLimitIntervalMs: 500,
});
```

#### Disabling Throttling

If you have slow calls that you want to resolve in parallel, you can disable throttling for specific instances:

```ts
const canvas = new CanvasApi("https://canvas.local/", "");

const canvasWithoutThrottling = new CanvasApi("https://canvas.local/", "", {
  disableThrottling: true,
});
```

You can mix instances with and without throttling. Instances with throttling disabled will bypass the global queue entirely.

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot rate limiting and request issues:

```bash
CANVAS_API_DEBUG=true node your-script.js
```

This will output rate limiter activity to stderr, including:

- When the work loop starts/stops
- Rate limit bounces and delays
- Request completion status

### TypeScript Types

The library exports the following types for TypeScript users:

```typescript
import {
  CanvasApi,
  CanvasApiResponse,
  QueryParams,
  RequestOptions,
  ExtendedGenerator,
  // Error classes
  CanvasApiError,
  CanvasApiResponseError,
  CanvasApiRequestError,
  CanvasApiTimeoutError,
  CanvasApiPaginationError,
} from "@kth/canvas-api";
```

### Type safety

This library parses JSON responses from Canvas and converts them to JavaScript object. If you want to check types at runtime, use a validation library:

```ts
import { CanvasApi } from "@kth/canvas-api";
import { z } from "zod";

const canvas = new CanvasApi(
  "<YOUR CANVAS INSTANCE>/api/v1",
  "<YOUR CANVAS TOKEN>",
);
const accountSchema = z.object({
  id: z.number(),
  name: z.string(),
  workflow_state: z.string(),
});

const { json } = client.get("accounts/1");
const parsed = accountSchema.parse(json);
```

### Error handling

This library returns instances of `CanvasApiError`. Check the [file `src/canvasApiError.ts`](./src/canvasApiError.ts) to see all the error classes that this library throws

## Development

### Dev-Env as code with `nix-shell`

We use nix package manager to get a consistent developer experience across devices (Linux/macOS):

- shell.nix -- equivalent of package.json but for system packages
- .nix/source.json -- equivalent of package-lock.json but pinned to a commit in the nix package repo

[Installing the Required Nix Tools](https://confluence.sys.kth.se/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=193409170) and setting up your editor. This page also contains instructions or pointers for how to set up your editor.

Run `nix-shell` in the root directory and it will install the required packages for the project. You won't need nvm or similar to switch Node.js version and you will get the correct version of Node.js, az, openssl, etc.

#### Setting up your own environment

The Nixpkgs-setup is a declarative configuration of the development environment. You can choose to install the packages manually on your local system.
